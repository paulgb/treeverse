# Treeverse

Treeverse is a web application for visualizing Bluesky conversations as trees.

From 2014-2023, Treeverse was a bookmarklet and later Chrome/Firefox extension for visualizing Twitter conversations.
That version was killed by changes to Twitter's API, but the code is still available in the [`old-treeverse` branch](https://github.com/paulgb/treeverse/tree/old-treeverse).

# Using it

You can use Treeverse online at [treeverse.app](https://treeverse.app).

# Running it locally

To run it locally, you can use the following commands in the base of this repo:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
